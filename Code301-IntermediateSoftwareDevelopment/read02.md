# JQuery

definition : jquery its a JavaScript library let you find the element and the css style then apply your methods or function easily.<br>

WHY USE JQUERY?<br>
nothing special in JQuery but it makes coding simpler.<br>

## JQuery methods ( set and get data)
to pick an element we use `$` to, e.g.:
 1. `$('li')`
 2. `$('#nameOfTheID')`
 3. `$('#nameOfTheclass')`<br>
 
 ## checking the Readiness
 .ready() method checks that the page is ready for your code code to work with. <br>

 `$(document).ready(...){   }`

 ## Getting element content 
 two methids to do that :<br>
 1. `$(..).html()`; get the data and the descendants
 2. `$(..).text()`; get the text(data) from the descendants.<br>

 ## Updating elements
 1. `$(...).html()`
 2. `$(...).text()`
 3. `$(...).replaceWith()`
 4. `$(...).remove()`

 ## Inserting content
 1. `$(...).before()`
 2. `$(...).after()`
 3. `$(...).prepend()`
 4. `$(...).append()`
  # Getting and Setting attribute values
  1. `$(...).atte()` e.g `$('li').atte('id','name')`
  2. `$(...).removeAttr()` to remove specified attribute
  3. `$(...).addClass()` :This method adds a new valueto the existing value of the class attribute. It does not overwrite existing values.
  4. `$(...).removeClass()` : This method removes a value from the cl ass attribute, leaving any other class names within that attribute intact.

And there are so many instructions with **JQuery**

# part two : 6-reasons-for-pair-programming
Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves<br>

## 1. Greater efficiency
Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product)
## 2. Engaged collaboration
When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.

## 3. Learning from fellow students

Often times, the developers in a pairing have different skill sets. If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area. The less experienced developer benefits from the experienced developer’s knowledge and guidance, and the latter benefits from explaining the topic in their own words, further solidifying their own understanding.

## 4. Social skills
When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities.<br>
This has long-term career impacts. As much as employers want strong programmers, they know it’s essential to hire people who can work well with others.

## 5. Job interview readiness

They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base.<br>

For most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.

## 6. Work environment readiness
Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.
