# Component Composition

**Can a parent component access the state of a child component?**  
It seems to be possible to do this by lifting the state up. This way the state of the parent and child can be changed simultaneously.

**What can be passed along in a prop variable?**  
Props can be numbers, strings, objects, arrays, functions. It seems that you can pass almost anything you need to move data around the app.

**How can a child component “know” the state of another component?**  
They can trigger callback functions, and the parent component will pass the information as requested. It also seems that Redux helps with this.
