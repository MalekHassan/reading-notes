## Express Routing & Connected API

#### Modularizing Routes In Express API Apps

- Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing.
- Types of routes:

* **Basic Routes**: Home, About
* **Route Middleware**: to log requests to the console
* **Route with Parameters**
* **Route Middleware for Parameters** to validate specific parameters
* **Login routes** Doing a GET and POST on /login
* Validates a parameter passed to a certain route

- Usually we use these files as these roles:

  - `index.js` - Entry Point.
  - `server.js` - Hub, Exported Server.
  - `models/categories.js, etc` - Data Models.
  - `routes/categories.js, etc` - Routers and Handlers.

- With the inclusion of the Express 4.0 Router, we are given more flexibility than ever before in defining our routes; we can:
  - Use express.Router() multiple times to define groups of routes.
  - Apply the express.Router() to a section of our site using app.use().
  - Use route middleware to process requests.
  - Use route middleware to validate parameters using .param().
  - Use app.route() as a shortcut to the Router to define multiple requests on a route.
