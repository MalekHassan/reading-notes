## Express Routing & Connected API

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1- Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware

- Authorization and validation
- fetch data from different API’s.
- Validate a data before store it in database.

  2- True or false: The route handler is middleware? false

  In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
  Sending a response that holding a data.

  3- At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
  Using the next() parameter that sends the data.

  4- What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”
  If we send two response for the same request that would cause an error.

  ## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

  - Middleware : functions are functions that have access to the request object ( req ), the response object ( res ), and the next function in the application's request-response cycle.

  - Request Object: represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on.
  - Response Object: The res object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request
  - Application Middleware: represented by app.use() and app.METHOD(), where METHOD is the HTTP method(in lowercase).
  - Routing Middleware: works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router().

#### Modularizing Routes In Express API Apps

- Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing.
- Types of routes:

* **Basic Routes**: Home, About
* **Route Middleware**: to log requests to the console
* **Route with Parameters**
* **Route Middleware for Parameters** to validate specific parameters
* **Login routes** Doing a GET and POST on /login
* Validates a parameter passed to a certain route

- Usually we use these files as these roles:

  - `index.js` - Entry Point.
  - `server.js` - Hub, Exported Server.
  - `models/categories.js, etc` - Data Models.
  - `routes/categories.js, etc` - Routers and Handlers.

- With the inclusion of the Express 4.0 Router, we are given more flexibility than ever before in defining our routes; we can:
  - Use express.Router() multiple times to define groups of routes.
  - Apply the express.Router() to a section of our site using app.use().
  - Use route middleware to process requests.
  - Use route middleware to validate parameters using .param().
  - Use app.route() as a shortcut to the Router to define multiple requests on a route.
