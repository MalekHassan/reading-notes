# `<Login />` and `<Auth />`

**Why is the Context API useful?**  
The Context API is useful because it can change important values for many components at once from a centralized location, without all of the values having to be passed through many layers of props.

**Can a component outside of a provider get its context?**  
It needs to be in a provider, or in a component whose parent is wrapped in the provider.

**What are some common use cases for using the Context API?**  
It can be used to show who is logged in and what authorizations they have.

**Describe “Context Hell”**  
Without useContext, you many have to pass props through many layers of components to get info to the right place. This can be frustrating and can lead to easy to miss mistakes.
