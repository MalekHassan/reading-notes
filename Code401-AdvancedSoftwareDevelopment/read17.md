**Given the examples of front-end events such as button click, window resize, form submit, etc, what are some examples of back-end events?**  
An example would be a user going online or offline, or it can check that an email or message was sent.

**Why are events sometimes better than asynchronous actions with callbacks?**  
The benefit of events is that they can handle more complex tasks in a readable way, and they can be called many times, whereas a Promise can only be resolved once.

**What does an EventEmitter instance do?**  
The instance can set an event listener that will trigger a function when a certain event occurs. you can attach in to the triggering function and to function that will be called.

**When is a programâ€™s call stack, event queue, and event loop active?**
The event loop runs continuously. The event queue is where event handler functions wait to execute. The call stack is where functions wait to execute.

| Observer Pattern         | An object, called the subject, will have observers. When the state changes, the subject will immediately notify the objects.                                                                  |
| Listener                 | Something that listens for an event that will trigger a function.                                                                                                                             |
| Event Handler            | The callback function that will run when an event triggers it.                                                                                                                                |
| Event Driven Programming | Programming where when an event happens, the next function is called. It makes use of callback functions with an event handler, and a main loop that listens for event triggers.              |
| Event Loop               | When Node.js starts, it kicks off the event loop. There is a queue of phases that the loop goes through one at a time, and it will go back to the top when it is done with all of the phases. |
| Event Queue              | A queue where each "node" contains an event, and the application will run through the events as part of the event loop. It is a way to acheive asynchronous programming.                      |
| Call Stack               | The call stack is where functions are placed before they are called. When another function is called within a function, the called function goes to the top of the stack.                     |
| Emit/Raise/Trigger       | Emitters are the objects that trigger events. Raising describes when the event is emitted.                                                                                                    |
| Subscribe                | This is how you listen for an event to happen. You subscribe to an event that will trigger the callback function.                                                                             |
| database                 | A structured and organized collection of data that is stored and accessed by a computer system.                                                                                               |
