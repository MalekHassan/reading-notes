**Describe use cases for `useMemo()` and `useReducer()`**  
`useReducer()` is useful when you need to use complex state logic, when you have mulitple sub values, or when the next state depends on the previous state. Use `useMemo()` runs during rendering, and it will only recompute the memoized value when one of its dependants has changed. This is an optimized way to avoid calculations every rerender.

**Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?**  
It needs the prefix so that looking at it, you can immediately tell that it is a hook. Without this, it looks just like a regular function.

**What do custom hooks usually do?**  
They give functionality that can be used across multiple components, and they are better than functions because they can access state and component lifecycle.

**Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications**  
react-use-form-state is a hook that helps maintain the state in different parts of an app. This could be really useful, as this has been a challenge in the ToDo app.

**Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work**  
An API fetching hook would take in a url and any info necessary for the request and return the results of the API call. It could use a callback to update the state with the returned results.
