**What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?**  
This is an efficient way of transfering data over networks and it limits latency.

**UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?**  
This is because with UPD no connection needs to be established between the origin and destination before tranferring data.

**Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?**  
Yes, a socket server can have more than one socket connection. We did this during our lab.  
**Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?**  
I do not believe so. Each socket is bound to a single port.

**Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?**  
It seems that a socket is mostly used to connect to a socket server, and not to be a server itself. However, I don't see why you could not have both in the same application.

| OSI Model | OSI stands for Open System Interconnection. It is a conceptual framework for understanding the networking process. The seven layers of OSI are Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. |
| TCP Model | This is a more concise version of the OSI Model, and it consists of four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, and Network.                                                                                                 |
| TCP       | This stands for Transmission Control Protocol. In this, the server must be listening for connections from clients.                                                                                                              |
| UDP       | This stands for User Datagram Protocol. Unlike TCP, there is no need to establish a connection before transfering data.                                                                                                         |
| Packets   | A unit of data that goes from one place to another over a network.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Socket    | A socket is an endpoint for sending and receiving data. Sometimes this refers to an internet socket, where a socket is identified to other hosts by its socket address.                                                         |
