| redux toolkit slices | There is a redux toolkit function called `createSlice()` that takes in an initial state, an object of reducer functions, and a 'slice name', and it generates action creators and action types corresponding to the reducers and state. |
| namespace            | You can create namespaces for action creators in Redux. This allows multiple instances of components to co-exist with independent space.                                                                                                |
