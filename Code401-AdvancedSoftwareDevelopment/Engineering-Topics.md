# How to Solve Programming Problems

#### Most programmers make key mistakes when given a programming problem during an interview

* Avoid trying to write code as soon as possible
  * Make sure you take the time to fully understand the problem before attempting to solve it
  * Avoid trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration. Keep it simple and don't try to get fancy

* Simple steps to solve any algorithm type programming problem
  * Read the problem completely twice
    * Test whether you can explain the problem to someone else
    * If given examples, work through them and understand why the answers are correct for each one
    * If you don't understand the problem, you cannot solve it
  * Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data
    * Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually
    * It is important to solve manually first so you know what you will automate
    * Seek corner cases and edge cases
    * Recognize what your brain is doing to solve a problem manually
  * Optimize the manual steps
    * Worth the effort to optimize or simplify manual solution
    * Figure out another way to solve the problem easier or with less code
  * Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code
    * Can be skipped if you have a good handle on the problem
    * Capture all the steps you created and write them as pseudo-code that can be translated to real code
  * Replace comments or pseudo-code with real code
    * Take each comment or pseudo-code and simply write code
  * Optimize real code
    * Look for ways to simplify your code
    * Optimize variable names meaningfully
    
* As much as 70% of time should be spent on steps 1-3


# Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You'll Become 100x More Productive

### How you value your time is how you value your life

* Most people value their time at far less than it's worth
* What if you placed a high value on your time?
  * How would you change your life, family, future?
* Busyness isn't a badge of honor, it is a sign of weakness

* Your time is not unlike your paycheck. If you don't budget for things you will have nothing left over by the end of the month
* **The state of all who are preoccupied is wretched, bu the most wretched are those who are toiling not even at their own preoccupations...If such people want to know how short their lives are, let them reflect how small a portion is their own**

* Busyness and stress are the enemy

* Extremely successful people don't tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day

* As you think so you are
  * Teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable. People will respond in kind
  * What you think is what you become. 

* You can do amazing things, but only if you have time to do them



# How to think like a programmer -- lessons in problem solving

### Thinking like a programmer is all about a more effective way to problem solve

#### Unless you have a system for problem-solving, you likely try randomly with something like this.

* Try a solution
* If that doesn't work, try another one
* If that doesn't work, repeat step 2 until you luck out

* **The best way to solve problems is to establish a framework and practice it**

* Establish a framework
  * **Understand** - Know exactly what is being asked. 
    * Most hard problems are hard due to a lack of understanding
    * You will know when you understand a problem when you can explain it in plain English
    * Write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it 
  * **Plan** - Don't dive right into solving without a plan
    * Write down exact steps
    * Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process information
    * Use comments to devise the plan
  * **Divide** - Do not try to solve one big problem
    * Break problem into sub-problems that are much easier to solve
    * Begin with the simplest, either those you know the answer to or those that don't depend on others being solved
    * Connect the dots between solved sub-problems
  * **Stuck?** - The best programmers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated
    * Debug - Go step by step through your solution 
    * Reassess - Take a step back and look at the problem from another perspective
    * Don't get lost in the details of a problem and overlook the general principles that would solve it at a more general level
    * Research - Google is your friend
  * **Practice** - Don't expect to be great after just one week. 
    * Try to solve at least one challenge every day
    

    # 5 Whys - Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

* Recurrent problems are often a sign of deeper issues
* Quick fixes seem convenient, but do not get to the root problem
* 5 Whys technique developed by Japanese industrialist **Sakichi Toyoda** in the 1930s.

* Simple method - When a problem occurs, drill down to its root by asking **Why** five times. Then, when the counter-measure becomes apparent, follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring
  * The method uses "counter-measures" rather than "solutions" as counter-measures are an action or set of actions to prevent the problem from arising again. They tend to be more robust tha  a "solution".

* Use 5 Whys Method for troubleshooting, quality improvement and problem solving. Most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems

* Might not be useful to solve complex or critical problems as it can result in the pursuit of a single track or limited possible counter-measures when there could actually be multiple causes to an issue.

### How to use the 5 Whys Method

* Assemble a team
* Define the problem
  * Observe the problem in action if you can
* Ask the first "Why"
  * For instance, ask your team why the problem is occurring
* Ask "Why" four more times
  * For each answer in the previous step, ask four more "whys in succession. 
  * Frame the question in response to the answer just recorded
* Know When To Stop
  * You will know when you've revealed the root cause of a problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses.
* Address the Root Cause(s)
  * Discuss and agress on the counter-measures
* Monitor counter-measures
  * Keep a close watch to see how effective counter-measures are
