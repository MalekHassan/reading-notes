# Access Control (ACL)

**When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?**
Basic authorization is the simplest version of authorization and the least secure. It may be used for a read only resource, and it should only be used with HTTPS because the encryption can be easily reversed. Bearer authoriztion uses a token and is more secure for an exchange between a client and a server.

**What does the JSON Web Token package do?**  
It defines packages for securely transmitting information as a JSON object. It is can be signed with a secret, whcih certifies that the only owner of the secret is the party the signed the JWT.

**What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?**  
It is best to make a secret that is random and unguessable. It should be stored in the .env file, though there may be some better options. The goal with a secret is to make sure nobody has access to it, to keep your app secure.

| encryption     | The method by which information is converted into a secret code that protects the data from being easily understood.                                                                                                      |
| token          | These are strings or JWTs that let an api know that the token bearer is authorized.                                                                                                                                       |
| bearer         | The bearer is the 'owner' of the token in bearer authentication. The bearer shows the token and is granted access to the resource or URL.                                                                                 |
| secret         | This is often sent along with a client id to a resource to obtain a token. It is only known to the OAuth Client and the authorization server.                                                                             |
| JSON Web Token | A method for securely transmitting JSON objects between different parties. The tokens can be transmitted as query strings, header attributes, or in the body of a POST request. JWT is popular because of teh small size. |
